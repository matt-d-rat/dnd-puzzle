## About the Game

Deep within the forgotten dwarven mines your party encounters a large gorge, carved out by an active lava flow. You notice what appears to be a half-completed railroad bridge, and a series of levers. You must find a way to cross this dangerous gorge in order to continue your quest.

### Objective

Both player tokens must safely move to the otherside of the gorge, without falling into the lava. You win when **both** player tokens are moved onto the "finish" tiles (checkboard pattern).

### Controls

- Player tokens are moved with drag & drop.
- You can only interact with an item (leaver, chest) when you have a player token standing next to it (ie: on an adjacent square).


## Limitiations / TODO

Due to time constraints the current implementation has the following limitiations:

- There is nothing preventing you from dragging the player tokens immediately across to the "finish" tiles. But that kind of defeats the point of playing... so just don't do that ðŸ˜‰.


- The lava doesn't actually "kill" you, or trigger a lose condition (I ran out of time). But hey, this is for a D&D game, imagine that it does and reload the page if you mess up ðŸ™‚.

- There is not "multiplayer" support. Originally this was designed to be run in a remote D&D game, where the GM would be sharing their screen and in control of the tokens.
